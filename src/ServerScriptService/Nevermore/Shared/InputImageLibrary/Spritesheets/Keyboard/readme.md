Hey there!

Hope you make good use of this pack. You can use all these assets in any project you want to (be it commercial or not).
All of the assets are in the public domain under Creative Commons 0 (CC0)

I am "Nicolae Berbece" (also known as Xelu), I founded "Those Awesome Guys" and made "Move or Die" which is out right now on Steam.
You can contact me at nick@thoseawesomeguys.com

Feel free to credit me in case you use anything in this pack, but don't worry, I won't mind if you don't. ;)

Please share this pack with other fellow developers in need of such assets! In the spirit of good old chain mail, if you share this pack with 5 fellow devs, your game's steam review score will rise by 7% and a notable twitch streamer will pick it up for his stream.

Keep making awesome things!!!

~Nick
